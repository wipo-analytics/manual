## Acknowledgements 

The WIPO Manual on Open Source Tools for Patent Analytics, 2016, was written with the generous financial support of the Patent Office of Japan (JPO). The Manual was prepared under the direction of Mr. Yo Takagi (Assistant Director General) and under the supervision of Mr. Alejandro Roca Campa√±a (Senior Director) and Mr. Andrew Czajkowski (Head of Section). Mr. Anthony Cutter prepared and analyzed the survey on the use of tools for patent analytics by patent information professionals. We are grateful to the participants in two regional workshops on patent analytics which took place in 2015 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Manila, Philippines who were presented with the draft Manual and who provided useful feedback, facilitating the optimization and completion of the Manual. We would also like to thank Ms. Alica Daly, Director of the IP Analytics Hub, IP Australia, as well as Mr. Rich Corken, Head of Informatics at the UK IPO for the fruitful discussions and for sharing their experiences with open source tools. The development of this Manual would have not been possible without the excellent support and troubleshooting provided by the open source tools community.  Ms. Catherine Oldham offered valuable comments throughout the preparation of the report and assistance with editing.  Thanks go to colleagues in the Communications Division and in the Printing Plant for their services.
